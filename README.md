# Simple Computer Viruses - Educational Project

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This project contains educational demonstrations of potentially harmful code. Use only in isolated, controlled environments for learning purposes.**

## Overview

This repository contains educational demonstrations of simple computer viruses and malicious scripts created as part of a **Network Security course** in December 2020. These examples are designed to help students understand malware behavior patterns, replication mechanisms, and the importance of cybersecurity awareness.

## üéØ Educational Purpose

This project serves as a hands-on learning tool for:
- Understanding how viruses replicate and spread
- Analyzing different types of malicious behaviors
- Learning defensive programming techniques
- Developing cybersecurity awareness
- Studying malware behavior patterns in a controlled environment

## üìÅ Project Contents

### Python Viruses

#### `s01.py` - Self-Replicating Virus
- Creates copies of itself with random names
- Executes the copied files
- Opens Google in the browser
- Demonstrates basic virus replication techniques

#### `del.py` - Destructive Script
- Deletes all files from the G: drive
- Uses Windows command line operations
- Shows destructive malware behavior

### VBScript Viruses

#### `box.vbs` - Message Box Spammer
- Creates infinite loop of message boxes
- Displays "salam" (Persian for "hello")
- Demonstrates system annoyance techniques

#### `box2.vbs` - Interactive Counter Virus
- Interactive counting virus with Persian text
- Endless loop of message boxes
- Asks user if they're tired yet
- Shows social engineering aspects

#### `voice.vbs` - Voice-Based Virus
- Continuously speaks "ha ha ha"
- Uses Windows SAPI speech synthesis
- Demonstrates audio-based system annoyance

#### `New Text Document.vbs` - Simple Message Box
- Basic message box displaying "salam"
- Simple demonstration of VBScript execution

### Documentation
- `viruses.pdf` - Educational materials about computer viruses
- `viruses.pptx` - Presentation slides on virus concepts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### **FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**
- These scripts are created **exclusively for educational purposes**
- They demonstrate potentially harmful behaviors
- **DO NOT** run on production systems or personal computers
- Use only in isolated, virtual environments

### **Safety Guidelines**
1. **Never execute on a real system**
2. Use virtual machines or sandboxed environments
3. Ensure no important data is accessible
4. Disconnect from networks when testing
5. Understand the code before running

## üõ°Ô∏è Responsible Usage

This project is intended for:
- Cybersecurity students
- Security researchers
- Educational institutions
- Controlled learning environments

**Not intended for:**
- Malicious purposes
- Production environments
- Unauthorized testing
- Harmful activities

## üìö Learning Objectives

By studying these examples, students can learn:
- **Virus Replication**: How malware copies itself
- **System Interaction**: How scripts interact with operating systems
- **Social Engineering**: Psychological manipulation techniques
- **Defensive Programming**: How to protect against such attacks
- **Security Awareness**: Understanding threat vectors

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Virtual Machine software (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.)
- Python 3.x installed
- Windows OS (for VBScript examples)
- Isolated network environment

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a new virtual machine
2. Install Python 3.x
3. Clone this repository
4. Ensure no important data is accessible
5. Disconnect from networks

## üî¨ Safe Testing Examples

### Testing Python Viruses
```bash
# In your isolated VM
python s01.py  # Will create copies and open browser
```

### Testing VBScript Viruses
```bash
# In your isolated VM
cscript box.vbs  # Will show message boxes
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Always test in virtual machines only!**
